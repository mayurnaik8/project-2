step wise

Input Handling
 Learn how to capture user input in Python.
 Use the input() function to read a line of text entered by the user.

String Manipulation
 Process the text to count the number of words.
Use string methods to split the text into words based on whitespace.
Count the number of words in the list obtained from the split operation.

Function Creation
Write a function to encapsulate the word-counting logic.
Define a function that accepts a string as input and returns the count of words.
Ensure the function handles empty strings or strings with only whitespace by returning a count of zero in such cases.

Basic Control Flow
Manage the program's logic and handle edge cases.
Implement control flow to check if the input is empty or consists only of whitespace.
Use appropriate conditions to handle such cases and return the correct word count.

Output Display
Display the word count to the user.
Create a main() function to:
Prompt the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.
Call the word-counting function and retrieve the word count.
Print the word count in a clear and informative manner.
Ensure that the main() function is executed when the script is run directly.
